The following approach I used for image grouping:

1.Preprocessing of images in which I reduced dimension of images to 32*32 and normalised pixel 
values.

2.After preprocessing of images standard unsupervised algorithm KMeans clustering I used to form cluster of images which gave really good result was able to form groups of different products.

3.Using labels_ attribute of kmeans model/class I used for visualing whether images of same product are clustered in one or not.
